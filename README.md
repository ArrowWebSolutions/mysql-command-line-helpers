MySQL Command Line Helpers
==========================

These are some simple scripts to make working with multiple MySQL databases much easier.

As we web developer I often found myself with multiple databases, I like to keep MySQL lean and small - i.e. only running the databases I'm working on. I also wanted a way to back up the databases using TimeMachine.

So I wrote some scripts to make it easy to add and remove databases from MySQL. They use an offline store (a folder on your machine) and an online store (MySQL). You can easily move databases between these stores, run a backup, query which databases are online and offline.
